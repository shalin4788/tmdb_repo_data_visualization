# tmdb_repo_data_visualization
In this project, we will be analyzing data related to TMDb movie database. In particular, we will be interested in finding trends related to the movie genres that were most popular year on year. Also we will be finding out the kinds of properties that are associated with movies that have high revenues ex: ROI, popularity and vote_average by plotting histogram, scatter plots and bar charts to draw conclusions about the dataset Note: Due to the data spread across 100 years, for the sake of clearer representation of data on charts and graphs, tail function is used at multiple places
