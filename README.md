**Install**
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

Install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `tmdb_repo_data_visualization/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook investigate-a-dataset-code.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook investigate-a-dataset-code.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

**About project**
In this project, we will be analyzing data related to TMDb movie database. In particular, we will be interested in finding trends related to the movie genres that were most popular year on year. Also we will be finding out the kinds of properties that are associated with movies that have high revenues ex: ROI, popularity and vote_average by plotting histogram, scatter plots and bar charts to draw conclusions about the dataset Note: Due to the data spread across 100 years, for the sake of clearer representation of data on charts and graphs, tail function is used at multiple places
# Questions to be answered
Which genres of movies are most popular from year to year?
What is the ROI of movies over the years?
What kinds of properties are associated with movies that have high revenues?
